                        <p class="member-funfact">After Dusick was forced to bow out of the band in 2006, Flynn was recruited to take over on the drums. He's the oldest member of the group and a veteran musician — prior to taking the stage as a permanent member of Maroon 5, Flynn was the drummer for the B-52's and Gavin DeGraw, Rolling Stone noted.
    
                            Flynn typically hangs back when it comes to interviews with the rest of the band. According to his bio on Maroon 5's official fan club — the "S.I.N. Club" — page, though, his favorite color is green, he "[plays] drums kinda good," and he likes "sports and sometimes beer."</p>

                            Valentine grew up in Nebraska playing jazz guitar and was raised in the Mormon church. When the band recruited him to play guitar post-Kara's Flowers, he suddenly found himself at a bit of a crossroads.
                            
                            "At the time it came to either go on a mission or move to California, I went on a different path," he told Desert News in September 2018. "I went to California and formed this band."</p>

                        <h4>Bass</h4>
                        <p class="member-funfact">Madden has been playing bass with the group since the Kara's Flowers days, which is around the same time he decided to go vegan. "I’m a really big lover of animals," he told VegNews in 2010, "and, at the risk of sounding like a total hippie, I do feel more connected to the world at large and to animals."
    
                            He also told the outlet that the rest of the band is pretty health-conscious too, and Levine, in particular has seemingly picked up on some of his vegan eating habits. "All the band members are meat-eaters, but they’re not close-minded and [they] understand the principles of veganism," he explained.
                            
                            Despite having been in and around show business for most of his life — his father, Robin, was a TV writer — Madden still isn't immune to getting starstruck. According to an interview with Rolling Stone in 2007, his most memorable celebrity encounter was when he met both Jay-Z and Bruce Springsteen within 5 minutes of each other at Madison Square Garden.</p>

                        <h4>Samples, keys, acoustic, percussion, and background vocals.</h4>
                        <p class="member-funfact">Farrar, yet another veteran musician in the group, first gained notoriety by playing bass in Phantom Planet when he was just 16. Sound familiar? Remember "California," aka the theme song to The OC? Yep, that was them.
    
                            According to the bio on Farrar's personal website, he joined Maroon 5 in 2012, "functioning as a utility guy of sorts. I play samples, keys, acoustic, percussion and sing some back ground vocals."
                            
                            He also notes on his site that he's written and/or produced for a ton of well-known artists in addition to Maroon 5, including Sara Bareilles, JR JR, and Gomez. Farrar likes to draw, too, and once went to a summer camp devoted to architecture.</p>

                        <h3>PJ Morton</h3>

                        <p class="member-funfact">Morton was made an official member of the group in 2012, after taking over the keys for Carmichael during his brief hiatus. He was already an established musician before joining Maroon 5, though, and has been nominated for a whopping 10 Grammy Awards over the course of his career.
    
                            At this year's Grammys, Morton is up for four awards total: One for his work on Maroon 5's "Girls Like You" in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category, and three for Gumbo Unplugged — his hip-hop and R&B-inspired solo debut.
                            
                            In January 2018, Morton spoke to NPR about the recent resurgence of hip-hop and R&B in popular music. "I just think it's very important music," he told the outlet. "It's music that we feel very deeply, and I think people are in need of connection right now. We want to fill each other right now because the world is a bit crazy. And I think it's music that goes straight to the heart."</p>
